# dafavorites
Fetch user's favorite deviations from deviantart.com

# Usage
Once built, the application would be used as follows to get a list of and download favorite deviations for user _denarced_:

    ./dafavorites denarced
  
The command would write the favorites into deviantFetch.json and download the
deviations to a temporary directory. At the moment you'll pretty have to read
the source code in order to understand properly what's being done.
